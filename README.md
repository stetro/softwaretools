Tools and Evaluation Methods used in Open Source Development 
============================================================

> An essay for a course called Software Tools and Evaluation at UTA, Tampere in Finnland


Introduction
------------

One says that the open source paradigm is one of the most promising strategies to improve the quality and efficiency of software development processes. This essay is introducing into the paradigm of open source, its software development model and its use of software engineering tools during the processes.

It also reviews some evaluation models and a framework to choose the right evaluation model for the specific need. After this introduction it will give an example how to use automated quality assurance with an open source project based NodeJS technologies and established with continues integration.


Conclusion
----------

The open source software development paradigm is one of the most upcoming way of new software development. But it is not about free software, its the idea of collaborating and giving the project the chance to get contributed by new ideas from programmers with different culture and needs. The used tools such as communication tools, version control tools and testing tools are the fundamental pieces to ensure this approach of collaborative work.

To benefit as user of open source software by this approach of open source development these huge amount of upcoming new software still need to be evaluated. Evaluation can be done to ensure that a searched open source product comes close to the actual needs of a given use case or to ensure product quality in view of maintainability, security and reliability. To carry out this evaluation Stol and Babar (2010) showed us about 20 evaluation frameworks and also a framework to compare and choose the right one for a specific need.

Another important evaluation is the success analysis for information systems by DeLone and McLean (1992). This model and also the newer version developed by them self ten years later is strongly context based and does not fit into the open source software scope. Thats why there was a need for a new model which is developed by Lee et al. (2009) who was revising the models by DeLone and McLean (1992) to the open source approach.

In the last part of this essay I tried to establish an example of testing, continues integration and automated quality assurance in a NodeJS based open source product called georeport.
